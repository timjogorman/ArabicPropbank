<!--
    A verb is the top level entity. 
    We associate with each verb frame file a set of 'frameset' elements
-->
<!ELEMENT verb (id, (comment | frameset)*)>

<!ELEMENT comment (#PCDATA)>

<!--
    A frameset contains a set of roles and a set of frames

    old version of frameset ordering:
    <!ELEMENT frameset (role,(comment | role)*,frame, (comment | frame)*)>

	edited 20 November 2012: 
	The order of frame, role, and comment elements doesn't matter.
	It is possible to have a frameset with no role or no frame, 
	but there should be at least one role or one frame.
-->
<!ELEMENT frameset (comment*,( (role,  (comment | role | frame )*) |
                               (frame, (comment | role | frame )*)  ))> 

<!--
    Each frameset has an identifier, and associates the verb
    with a verbclass (classid).  Optionally, chinese and english 
    definitions or glosses are allowed. 
	
    Arabic files use edef, but cdef may be an empty string.
	
    edited 20 November 2012: vncls and vntheta may appear but 
    are not relevant to Arabic data, so they'll be empty strings.
    "id" attribute is CDATA now.
-->

    id CDATA  #REQUIRED
    cdef CDATA #IMPLIED

<!--
    A frame consists of a set of tuples of mapping and example elements
	edited 20 Nov 2012: Comments can occur at the end, too, and all comments are optional.
-->
<!ELEMENT frame (((comment|mapping)*)?, example, (comment|example)*) > 

<!--
    A mapping is an ordered list of mapitems, with a verb in there somewhere

    eg

    <mapping>
        <mapitem src="sNP" trg="arg0"/>
        <V/>
        <mapitem src="dNP" trg="arg1"/>
    </mapping>
-->

<!-- edited 20 Nov 2012: Arabic data doesn't use mapping, so mapitem is optional. -->
<!ELEMENT mapping (V*, (mapitem | comment)*)> 
<!ELEMENT mapitem EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST mapitem
    src (sbj|npobj|ipobj|ext|dir|controlip|io|other) #REQUIRED
    trg (arg0|arg1|arg2|arg3|arg4|arg5|argM) #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT V EMPTY>

<!--
    finally, an example is completely unstructured, but we may optionally
    specify of source.
	edited 20 Nov 2012: allowing comments to occur at the end, too, and arg is optional.
