Data Format for the Arabic PropBank

A PropBank file contains PropBank instances (one instance per line), where each instance is represented by the following format.

<instance> ::= <tree_path> <tree_id> <predicate_id> <annotator_id> <lemma>-<type> <roleset_id> <aspects>( <argument>)+
<argument> ::= <terminal_id>:<height>-<label>

<tree_path>    ::= path to the Treebank file
<tree_id>      ::= index of the tree containing the predicate (starts with 0, indicating the 1st tree in <tree_path>)
<predicate_id> ::= terminal ID of the predicate (starts with 0, indicating the 1st terminal node of the tree)
<annotator_id> ::= ID of the annotator (default for adjudicated instances: gold)
<lemma>        ::= lemma of the predicate
<type>         ::= type of the predicate (n: non-verb, v: verb)
<roleset_id>   ::= sense ID of the predicate
<aspects>      ::= no longer used (default: -----)
<terminal_id>  ::= ID of the 1st terminal node in this argument
<height>       ::= height of this argument phrase from its 1st terminal node
<label>        ::= PropBank label

Example:
Here is an example based on PropBank file (wsj_0001.prop). The first instance indicates a verb-predicate "join" (join-v) whose roleset ID is "join.01", which is the 9th terminal node (predicate_id = 8) of the 1st tree (tree_id = 0) in the Treebank file, wsj_0001.parse.

wsj_0001.parse 0 8 gold join-v join.01 ----- 0:2-ARG0 7:0-ARGM-MOD 8:0-rel 9:1-ARG1 11:1-ARGM-PRD 15:1-ARGM-TMP
wsj_0001.parse 1 2 gold be-v be.01 ----- 0:1-ARG1 2:0-rel 3:2-ARG2
wsj_0001.parse 1 10 gold publish-v publish.01 ----- 10:0-rel 11:0-ARG0

The argument "9:1-ARG1" indicates the phrase, "(NP (DT the) (NN board))", in the tree (see below) because "(DT the)" is the 10th terminal node and "(NP (DT the) (NN board))" has a height 1 from this terminal node.

MULTIPLE NODES FOR ARGUMENTS: On LINK arguments
Additionally an argument can specify more than one node a tree linked by a (*) link. 

Example 2:
Here is an example based on the 3-D tree in PropBank file (bolt-eng-DF-200-192448-6189512.parse). The terminal nodes have been labeled to the left of the tree and the annotated relation has been marked to the right of the node for readability purposes.

  21:         (. .)))

Sentence:
"Aggression and hostility is obviously the worst way *PRO* to go about to get these changes made *T*."

This example shows two types of multiple node linking. Multiple nodes are found in the LINK argument (LINK-SLC) and the ARGM-MNR argument. The motivation behind the multiple node linking here is to capture the semantics of the trace (*T*) and link it to the proper semantic antecedent.

LINK-SLC specifies a semantic relationship between the two linked nodes. All properly annotated LINK-SLC arguments will always have the following properties: 
- multiple nodes lined with "*"
- at least one of the nodes will sit inside the domain of locality of the predicate -- generally, within the S or SBAR node headed by the predicate of concern
- an anchoring node that carries an ARGM or a numbered argument label.

In this example, the argument "5:1*8:1-LINK-SLC", the local node "8:1" referring to the node "(WHADVP-4 (-NONE- 0))" is the argument relevant to the predicate "go" (go.06) and the node "8:1" has been specified as its semantic antecedent. The anchoring node here is the trace in "5:1*8:1*20:1" labeled as "ARGM-MNR": "20:1" is the position of trace where the semantic antecedent should be interpreted, this is * linked to the node "8:1" through syntactic indexing (see index 4 in the tree), which is the same node to which SLC refers to. Finally the "ARGM-MNR" is linked to "5:1" of the SLC which specifies the semantic antecedent of the trace.

This allows the following paraphrased interpretation for the go:

"*PRO* go about to get these changes made 'in the worst way'"



MULTIPLE NODES FOR ARGUMENTS: On Concatenation:
In addition to (*), an argument can specify more than one node a tree linked by a (;) or (,). These are cases of semantic concatenation. Two syntactic constituents that are interpreted as a single semantic argument may be concatenated using (;) or (,).

Example 1: 
(;) concatenation is used to unite two constituents under the same argument label. 
First use is for ICH nodes. For more discussion on ICH trace nodes, please refer to Arabic TreeBank guidelines. The predicate of the instance and ICH in the following tree is marked for readability.

Sentence:
"Éalternative sources are being as enthusiastically pursued as the urgency of the situation dictatesÉ"

The ICH trace specifies that the SBAR at node 16:1 should be interpreted as being a part of the PP node at 12:1. Thus, in line with the TreeBank annotation, PropBank specifies that the ARGM-MNR argument of the verb "pursue" (pursue.01) includes both the phrases found at "10:2" and "16:1". Therefore, the two nodes are concatenated with the ';'.

Example 3:
(;) is also used to concatenate two syntactically separate but semantically similar nodes. 
Please note: This example is not a natural one, as this type of concatenation in English is handled through a (,).

The nodes at "0:1" and "2:1" are interpreted as a single semantic argument of the verb "seem" (seem.01). Thus the two nodes are concatenated into 0:1;2:1-ARG1.

Example 2:
(,) is used in the "rel" of the sentence. It specifies multiword predicate such as verb particle constructions.
